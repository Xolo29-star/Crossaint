        Croissant
    </h1>

    <p>A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie
        pastry
        inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants
        are named
        for their historical crescent shape.
